	<h1>Tired Nights</h1>
	<p>I love taking this course and all of the interesting things I have learned, but man I am exhausted lol. I think I'm pushing myself alot,but its only because i have such an interest in coding.</p>


	

	
	<h2>Plus more tired nights</h2>
	<p>On top of having a 1 year old daughter and working a full time job, I don't see rest in the near future. Seems like she doesn't want me to study lol.</p>

	<p>One day in the near future, these nights will be behind me and I will be very appreciative for the effort I put it to get through it.</p>
