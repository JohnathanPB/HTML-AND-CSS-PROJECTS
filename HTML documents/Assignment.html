	<p><h1>GET A RUNNING BACK</h1>
	Whether you draft for one or pay in the free agency, make sure to do so. Get a good one and pay him.</p>
	</main>

<h3>Go to Tight End and Reciever</h3>
<p>Tight ends are bigger and easier targets and can be utilized as blockers as well. A good receiver can make plays and draw extra attention from defenses, allowing others to make plays.</p>

<h6>Get a decent quarterback</h6>
<p>All that is needed is a quarterback who can make plays with their arm when needed but knows how to manage a game and read defenses. Even better if they can make plays with their legs as well.</p>

<p>Personnel means alot and finding the right pieces is like a chess match in a sense. It showed overall in the Eagles roster. As per Saquan Barkley via 6ABC.com:</p>

	"As a player and as the running back, to have the offensive line go to the coach and say this is something that we want to expand on means a lot," Barkley said. "It shows the trust they have in me and the trust that we have in each other because you can't do it without the guys up front. And we have the best offensive line in my opinion."
