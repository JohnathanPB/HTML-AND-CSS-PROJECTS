            <p>The resignation of the Worcester and Troy franchises from the National League after the 1882 season[14] created openings in the eight-team circuit for two new franchises, which were granted to New York and Philadelphia. The team has played at several stadiums in the city, including Recreation Park (1883–1886), the Baker Bowl (1887–1938), Shibe Park (later renamed Connie Mack Stadium in 1953, in honor of longtime Philadelphia Athletics manager Connie Mack) (1938–1970), Veterans Stadium (1971–2003), and now at Citizens Bank Park (2004–present).</p>
